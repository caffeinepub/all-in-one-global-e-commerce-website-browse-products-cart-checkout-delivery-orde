# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Rename the storefront branding to “Kaninwals E Commerce” everywhere it is user-visible, replacing “GlobalMart”.

**Planned changes:**
- Update storefront UI brand text (e.g., header brand text in StoreLayout) from “GlobalMart” to “Kaninwals E Commerce”.
- Update footer wording from “About GlobalMart” to “About Kaninwals E Commerce”.
- Update the HTML document metadata title in frontend/index.html to include “Kaninwals E Commerce”.

**User-visible outcome:** The website shows “Kaninwals E Commerce” as the brand in the header, footer, and browser tab/title, with the rest of the UI remaining in English and functioning normally.
